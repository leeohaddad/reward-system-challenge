# nu-challenge

This is a challenge for evaluating my Clojure learning process and my skills at the current moment.
Thank you Rodrigo Flores for all the good Clojure references you provided to me!

## Installation

Download from https://github.com/leeohaddad/reward-system-challenge.

## Prerequisites

This project was created using a project automation tool called Leiningen.
Using it, any user can run this project in a quick and easy manner.
You will need [Leiningen][] 2.0.0 or above [installed][leiningen-download].

This solution uses the following libraries:

- [Compojure][http-endpoints-lib]
- [data.json][json-lib]

So, if you don't have them, Leiningen will download it for you, since they are marked as dependencies.

## Running

With Leiningen installed, first move to the project root directory.

To start the web server for the application, run:

```sh
$ lein ring server
```

If you don't have Ring yet, Leiningen will also download ir for you.

After the server starts:
 - `/index.html` shows you a greetings page with the links to the endpoints.
 - `/` loads data from input.txt* and redirects to `/index.html`.
 - `/getRanking` shows you the json-formatted ranking.
 - `/addInvitation?from=ID1&to=ID2` adds a new invitation from ID1 to ID2 and shows the result.

 Example:
 - Access: `http://localhost:3000/getRanking/` -> Loaded initial data and showed index.html.
 - Access: `/getRanking` showed the json-formatted ranking.
 - Access: `/addInvitation?from=5&to=8` added a new invitation from customer 5 to customer 8 and showed the result.

You can also run the application using the terminal:

```sh
$ lein run "resources/input.txt"
```

Note that it's possible to build you database from scratch with add-invitation (`/addInvitation`).
All you need to do is to provide an empty input file and the database will be initiated also empty.

## Line of thought to build the solution

### The Awesome Foresight

Why limiting this source code to this specific challenge? All that functions can be extremely useful for other features.
Even the same feature may request something like another input method some day.
Of course we don't want to anticipate work that can end up not being used at all. But we can leave the field ready for our need from the future.
With that on mind, I tried to make the code as modular and reusable as possible.

### The Wonderful Data Structure

I chose to use a Tree to store the data for a pair of reasons:

 - To calculate the score of a customer, we need to analyze the score of all his invitees. So, something close to a DFS looks like a good solution, and Clojure may help us to use this structure to bring concurrency.
 - The inviter-invitee relation is similar to a parent-child relation, and that, allied to the one-inviter-per-invitee rule (comparable to one-parent-per-node/child rule), makes our data fit perfectly with the tree structure.

I implemented the Tree data structure in a very simple manner: each customer/invitee is a vector in the form [index & invitees].

### The *Even Better* Data Structure

Despite being the best option for the solution computation, the tree has been proven inefficient for inclusion, since we can't access elements without searching in the tree.

To solve this problem, I changed my data structure to something that still allows me quickly transverse the structure looking for result, but that also allows me to make inclusion in something close to O(1).

The result was a hash-map that contains:
 - Root: Customer that made the first invitation.
 - Data: hash-map of 2-dim vectors of sets. Customers are the hash-map keys and lead to the pair of sets that contain the invitees of that customer. The first set stores the valid invitations, while the second set stores the invalid invitations.
 - Invitees: A set of the already-invited customers, for interal control.

This data structure assumes there is only one non-invited customer (root).

### The Amazing Solution

The fact that invitations are worth (1/2)^k (k: invitation level) means that each direct invitee contributes to the inviter score with half it's own total score.
This means that, as mentioned, something DFS-like seems good to solve the problem.
This can be done through recursion or dynamic programming. Let's stick to the recursion, since we don't use the computed score of any invitee in any task other than computing his inviter score. 

### The Cycles Problem

Oh, well, not everything smells like flower, right? After finishing my solution implementation, I found a problem when testing it with the provided input.txt. I managed to find the only line that makes my program crash: "42 1". Removing it, the program was going fine. It could have been due to all the big misteries that lay around the number 42, but it was actually just a problem with cycles.
In fact, it makes a lot of sense, since cycles would create mutual dependencies, making it impossible to make the caculations.
To solve it, I made an assumption: if someone has made any invitation, this person counts as an invited person, even if no one has actually invited this person.
This way, we can apply the "multiple invites sent to the same person don't produce any further points" rule and apply the solution successfully.

### Next Steps

 - Find out why we lose the ranking sort (sort-by -> sorted -> reduce conj {} -> not sorted) when testing with input.txt.
 - Bring some concurrency.
 - Implement tests.

### Future Possibilities

 - Implement multiple roots (non-invited customers). For now, assumes it's unique.
 - Implement other nice ways of updating the database (e.g. a request that receives a list of invitations and adds them all).
