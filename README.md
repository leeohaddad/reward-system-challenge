# nu-challenge

This is a challenge for evaluating my Clojure learning process and my skills at the current moment.
Thank you Rodrigo Flores for all the good Clojure references you provided to me!

## Installation

Download from https://github.com/leeohaddad/reward-system-challenge.

## Prerequisites

This project was created using a project automation tool called Leiningen.
Using it, any user can run this project in a quick and easy manner.
You will need [Leiningen][] 2.0.0 or above [installed][leiningen-download].

This solution uses the following libraries:
- [Compojure][http-endpoints-lib]
- [data.json][json-lib]
So, if you don't have them, Leiningen will download it for you, since they are marked as dependencies.

## Running

With Leiningen installed, first move to the project root directory.

To start the web server for the application, run:

```sh
$ lein ring server
```

If you don't have Ring yet, Leiningen will also download ir for you.

After the server starts, '/' and '/index.html' show you a greetings page, while '/getRanking' gives you the json-formatted ranking.

You can also run the application locally:

```sh
$ lein run "input.txt"
```

## Thought line to build the solution

### The Awesome Foresight

Why limiting this source code to this specific challenge? All that functions can be extremely useful for other features.
Even the same feature may resquest something like another input method some day.
Of course we don't want to antecipate work that can end up not being used at all. But we can leave the field ready for our need from the future.
With that on mind, I tried to make the code as modular and reusable as possible.

### The Wonderful Data Structure

I chose to use a Tree to store the data for a pair of reasons:
 - To calculate the score of a customer, we need to analyse the score of all his invitees. So, something close to a DFS looks like a good solution, and Clojure may help us to use this structure to bring concurrency.
 - The inviter-invitee relation is similar to a parent-child relation, and that, allied to the one-inviter-per-invitee rule (comparable to one-parent-per-node/child rule), makes our data fit perfectly with the tree structure.
I implemented the Tree data structure in a very simple manner: each customer/invitee is a vector in the form [index & invitees].

### The Amazing Solution

The fact that invitations are worth (1/2)^k (k: invitation level) means that each direct invitee contributes to the inviter score with half it's own total score.
This means that, as mentioned, something DFS-like seems good to solve the problem.
This can be done through recursion or dynamic programming. Let's stick to the recursion, since we don't use the computed score of any invitee in any task other than computing his inviter score. 

### Next Steps

 - Implement input from file.
 - Implement additional input from http endpoint.
 - Implement output to http endpoint.
 - Bring some concurrency.
 - Implement tests.
 - Split functions into modules.
 - Fix the refresh problem (inf +).
